# shopping-list
My attempt at building a basic shopping list web app

Requirements for version 0
1) Have a very simple, intuitive login page to identify users.

2) User can then create a new "shopping list" (the code should be as extendible as possible because idea is to build a future any "list", not just a shopping list) and can perform the following actions with that list:
	a) Create a deadline for that list by when it needs to be done
	b) Add items to that list
	c) Check items off aka remove them when the user is done purchasing them
	d) Share the list with family/friends/room mates and keep them in sync.
